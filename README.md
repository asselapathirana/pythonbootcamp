# Python Bootcamp 
This repo provides some of the code, data and information used during the Python Bootcamp, the course I run every year at IHE-Delft. 

## Inspiration
Some python products that may inspire you to learn the lanauge

## Installation
### Python
Most of the students use computers running Windows operating system. For them my recommended python distribution is [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/). 

As of 2019 we use Python 3.7. Please download the appropriate WinPyton distribution from [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.7/3.7.4.0/Winpython64-3.7.4.0.exe/download)

1. Its a big download (~650MB), so, give it time to download. 
2. Double clik on the downloaded file
3. Direct it to an installation directory (I use `C:\Python\wpy`)
4. Complete the installtion.

### Development Environment
An Integrated Development Enviornment (IDE) makes it easy to write Python code. WinPython comes with an excellent open source IDE called [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). You can use it. 

But my preferred (largely due to long-term use) IDE is the [Wing IDE](https://wingware.com/). Its a commercial product, but, there is a free version of this (Wing Personal). Further, you can have the full professional version free for open source projects. Nice people at Wing have made professional classroom licenses available. 
1. Download the Pro version from [This link](https://wingware.com/downloads/wing-pro) (Select 'Windows Installer'). 
2. Install the software. 
3. Open Wing IDE
4. When it askes for a license, ask me and I'll provide you with the classroom license.
